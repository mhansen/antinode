Antinode is a simple static file webserver built on node.js.

# Usage

Run it from the command line. 

   $ node server.js [settings.json]

Requires Node.JS v0.1.100 or greater.
If you want to bind to a port under 1024, you'll need to run node with special
privileges.

# Configuration

Configuration is through a JSON text file, by default the `settings.json` in
the same folder as `server.js`.

Example settings file:

    {
        "port" : 8080,
        "hosts" : {
            "subdomain1.example.com" : { 
                "root" : "/www/subdomain1/"
            },
            "subdomain2.example.com" : {
                "root" : "/www/subdomain2/"
            }
            },
        "default_host" : {
            "root" : "/www/default/"
        },
		"index_files" : [ "index.xhtml", "index.html" ]
    }

This server listens on port 8080 for HTTP requests.
If it gets a request for `Host: subdomain1.example.com` the site will serve
`/www/subdomain1/`, and similarly requests for `Host: subdomain2.example.com`
will respond with the files from `/www/subdomain2`. If the `Host` header does
not match either, or is not given, antinode will serve files from
`/www/default`.

Explanation of properties:

- `port` - the port to listen for HTTP connections on. default: 8080
- `hosts` - an object with one property name per virtual host address, with the value of a 'virtual host' object to 
- `default_host` - the 'virtual host' object to default to if no other virtual hosts match, or the HTTP `Host` header is not given
- `index_files` - if the requestâ€™s url is a directory, return the first index file from this list that has been found in the directory (if none was found, lists the directory).

'virtual host object' - has a property `root` giving the directory to serve
   web requests from


This serves up all the files in `/var/www` listening to HTTP requests on port 8080.
E.g. an HTTP request for `/styles/site.css` will will look for the file `/var/www/styles/site.css`

# Features

- HTTP `Content-Length` header support
- HTTP `Date` header
- HTTP `Last-Modified` header
- Reads files in binary mode - so can serve images and other binary files (not just text)
- Requests to any `directory` try to return an index file (from the settings)
- Directory listing
- Virtual Hosts

# Test Suite
